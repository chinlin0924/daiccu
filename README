How to get the knob running

Hardware
--------

Make sure you have the following hardware components available:

- The knob itself (Mercedes-Benz part number: A172 870 14 58 & A204 870 20 58)
- A CAN to USB converter (CANUSB, see http://www.canusb.com/)
- 2x twisted pair wires
- 2 D-Sub Crimp Female Pins
- 1 D-I-Y Banana Plug w/ Set Screw (Pomona 1825-02)
- 1 9Pin Female CRIMP HOUSING (DH 9HS/T P10) (http://zackelectronics.com/connectors/d-sub-connectors/sockets-plugs/pan-pacific-dh-9hs-t-d-sub-9-pin-female-crimp-housing-tin-plated.html)
- 1 4-Pin Connector
- 4 MQS Pins

Pin assignment 4-Pin Connector:
    1. GND (marked red)
    2. +12V
    3. CAN-High => D-SUB9 Pin 7
    4. CAN-Low => D-SUB9 Pin 2

Proceed as follows:

Cut off 2mm of the insulation on each end of wire #1 and #2. Fix a D-Sub Crimp
Female Pin each at one end of wire #1 and #2. Plug wire #2 into port seven of
the 9Pin Female CRIMP HOUSING and  wire #1 into port two. Fix a MQS-pin each at
the other ends of wires #1 and #2. Plug wire #1 into port four of the
4-Pin-Connector and wire #2 into port three.

Cut off 2 mm of the insulation of wire #3 and #4 on the one side and 5 mm on the
other side. Fix an MQS-pin each on the end of the wires whose insulation had
been cut off 2mm. Then plug wire #3 into port two of the 4-Pin-Connector and
wire #4 into port one.
Put wire #4's other end into the black banana plug. Put wire #3's other end
into the red banana plug.

In order to terminate the CAN bus you can either use a 120 Ohm resistor
connected between CAN_H and CAN_L or buy a CAN terminator, e.g.:
- Peak PCAN-Term (IPEK-003002)
- IXXAT CAN Terminator - pass through (1.04.0075.03000)

You can now connect the 9Pin Female CRIMP HOUSING with your CANUSB adapter and
the knob's cables with the other end of the 4-Pin-Connecter respectively.

Software
--------

You will need the FTDI VCP Driver found at http://www.canusb.com/.

In order to install it on a Windows system proceed as follows:
- Extract the driver that you have just downloaded to some location.
- Plug the USB cable to your computer.
- Go to the 'Device Manager', locate CANUSB and double click the device.
- Click on the 'Driver' tab, 'Update Driver' and specify the location to which
  you extracted the driver.
- After the driver has been installed, right-click on the CANUSB, click on
  'Properties', go to the 'Advanced' tab and check the 'Load VCP' check-box.
- Pull off the USB cable and plug it in again.
- The USBCAN device should now ask for another driver. Go to 'Driver' tab again,
  click 'Update Driver' and specify the same location of the FTDI driver again.
- Your CANUSB should now work properly. To verify that get the free 'TeraTerm'
  software (http://ttssh2.sourceforge.jp/index.html.en), specify the correct
  port (look it up at 'Device Manager' â†’ 'COM Ports'), type 'V' and press enter.
  If 'V1011' is returned, it is working correctly.

In general, Linux kernels are deployed with the required driver already on
board. If your system does not recognize the CANUSB device, make sure the
USB FTDI Single Port Serial Driver (Symbol: USB_SERIAL_FTDI_SIO) is enabled
within the Linux Kernel.

In order to test it you may download 'GtkTerm', 'moserial' or 'minicom', run it,
open and configure a new connection to the correct port and settings
(type 'dmesg | grep tty' in your shell to determine the port), type 'V' and
press enter. If 'V1011' is returned, it works correctly.

Running the application

If your OS is Linux, make sure 'libx11-dev' and 'libxtst-dev' is installed
('sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxtst-dev').

Execute the 'daiccu' executable from cmd line and pass the port name (e.g.
'daiccu.exe COM3' on Windows or './daiccu /dev/ttyUSB0' on Linux systems).
You can determine the correct port name by looking it up on the 'Device Manager'
(Windows) or by typing 'dmesg | grep tty' in your shell (Linux).
